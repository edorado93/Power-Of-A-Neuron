#Image Classification

* Implemented a logistic regression model for image classification of cats vs dogs.
* Published a detailed two part series explaining the bits and piecws of the entire process.
* The dataset used was the cats vs dogs image classification dataset from Kaggle.
* The dataset contains 25000 images in all and I split them as 20,000 in the training set and 5000 in the test set.
* Used Mean Squared Loss for Gradient Descent optimization and backpropagation.
* The model trained for 5000 epochs at a learning rate of 0.003 achieves 61% test set accuracy.


### Steps to replicate

1. Run the `preprocessing` notebook to convert the images into our actual dataset i.e. the one we will feed the model.
2. Go through the `logistic_regression_with_neural_networks_mindset` notebook for the training process.
